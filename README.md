# 📝 To-Do List

Welcome to the **To-Do List** project! Inspired by [Elzero Web School](https://elzero.org/), this tool is designed to help you stay organized and manage your daily tasks effectively. With a clean interface and easy-to-use features, you can keep track of everything you need to do!

2. **Mark as Completed**: Click on a task to mark it as done, or click again to unmark it.
3. **Delete Tasks**: Use the delete button next to each task to remove it from your list.
4. **Persistent Storage**: Your tasks are saved automatically, so you can close and return anytime without losing your data.
